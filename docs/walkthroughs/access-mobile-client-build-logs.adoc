All of the Mobile Client Builds can be found as pipeline builds in the Openshift Console.

==== Logging into Jenkins to access the logs

After you clicked the `View Log` link, you will be redirected to the Jenkins instance that has been running your build.
You might be prompted to log-in through Openshift, redirected to Openshit login screen and, if this is the first time you are using this account to
login to Jenkins, asked to authorize information transfer between Openshift and Jenkins to facilitate the login.

===== Openshift login

===== Authorize access

If you are asked to authorize permissions, you should be asked to approve access for:
* user:info permission
* user:authorize-access

==== Reviewing the build-log

Now you should have been redirected to Jenkins UI, and see the log of the build. Based on your permissions to the Openshift project,
you might have access to other Jenkins capabilities, such as inspecting the build configuration or re-running the build with changes in the pipeline script.
