= Developing the OpenShift UI Locally

This document outlines best practices for Aerogear OpenShift UI development.

Development is mainly done against the link:https://github.com/aerogear/origin-web-console[`origin-web-console`], the management console for OpenShift Origin. 
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-web-common[`origin-web-common`] and link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-web-catalog[`origin-web-catalog`] are both dependencies of the web console.
The former contains the common services used for the console and the latter contains components for the service catalog in the console. 

=== Getting started

. Ensure that a mobile-enabled OpenShift instance is running
. Install grunt and bower by running `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
. Install dev dependencies by running `make install`
. Change the default configuration file to point to your OpenShift instance. Copy `app/config.js` to `app/config.local.js` and change `masterPublicHostname` to the IP address of your OpenShift instance
. Configure your editor to use `.editorconfig`
. Launch the console and start watching for asset changes by running `grunt serve`. This should open <https://localhost:9000/> in your default browser.

For more information, see the link:https://github.com/aerogear/origin-web-console[`origin-web-console`] repo. 

=== Making PRs 

When creating PRs, use the following process as a guideline: 

. Create a feature branch on link:https://github.com/aerogear/origin-web-console[our Aerogear fork] named after the epic
. Make all pull requests for Jiras in that epic to the feature branch
. Once all the of the PRs for that feature are closed, the branch will be used to create a single upstream PR. 
Rebase on master, squash to a single commit and run `./hack/verify-dist.sh` to verify that the built dist files are the same as the committed version. If this fails, run the following commands:
* `make clean && make install` to make sure all dev dependencies are up to date
* `grunt build` to rebuild the dist files

. Commit these changes and create a new PR against link:https://github.com/origin/origin-web-console[origin].

*PR checklist*

* Add a link to the Jira in the description
* Add a list of verifications steps
* Add screenshots 
* Assign reviewers from the team
